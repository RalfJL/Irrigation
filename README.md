# Irrigation
Irrigation system based on Tasmota

Tasmota can be a very good base for own projects. It has support for a lot of sensors, has a nice easy WebUI, handles WiFi and MQTT and, as this writing, comes with Bluetooth and Berry as programming language on ESP32 boards.

So why not try to build a plant watering system with it?
